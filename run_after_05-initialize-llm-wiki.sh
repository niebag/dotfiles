# Wiki Schema

## Domain
TODO: describe what this wiki covers. Be specific — this constrains what
gets a page and what does not.

## Conventions
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g., `transformer-architecture.md`)
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter (see below)
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`
- **Provenance markers:** On pages that synthesize 3+ sources, append
  `^[raw/articles/source-file.md]` at the end of paragraphs whose claims come from a
  specific source. Optional on single-source pages where `sources:` is enough.

## Frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: Page Title
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
tags: [from taxonomy below]
sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
# Optional quality signals:
confidence: high | medium | low
contested: true
contradictions: [other-page-slug]
---
```

### raw/ Frontmatter

Raw sources ALSO get a small frontmatter block so re-ingests can detect drift:

```yaml
---
source_url: https://example.com/article   # original URL, if applicable
ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
sha256: <hex digest of the raw content below the frontmatter>
---
```

## Tag Taxonomy
TODO: define 10-20 tags for this domain, grouped by category. Example shape:

- People/Roles: ...
- Projects: ...
- Process: ...
- Technical: ...
- Meta: comparison, timeline, workflow

Rule: every tag on a page must appear in this taxonomy. If a new tag is needed,
add it here first, then use it.

## Page Thresholds
- **Create a page** when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Add to existing page** when a source mentions something already covered
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, minor details, or things outside the domain
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines — break into sub-topics with cross-links
- **Archive a page** when its content is fully superseded — move to `_archive/`, remove from index

## Entity Pages
One page per notable entity (person, project, client). Include:
- Overview / what it is
- Key facts and dates
- Relationships to other entities ([[wikilinks]])
- Source references

## Concept Pages
One page per concept, technique, or process learning. Include:
- Definition / explanation
- Current state of knowledge
- Open questions or debates
- Related concepts ([[wikilinks]])

## Comparison Pages
Side-by-side analyses. Include:
- What is being compared and why
- Dimensions of comparison (table format preferred)
- Verdict or synthesis
- Sources

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Check the dates — newer sources generally supersede older ones
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Mark the contradiction in frontmatter: `contradictions: [page-name]`
4. Flag for user review in the lint report
